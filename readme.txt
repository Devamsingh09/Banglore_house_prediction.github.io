# Bangalore House Price Prediction 🏡📊  

Welcome to my **House Price Prediction Model**, which estimates housing prices in **Bangalore** based on location and other key features. This project applies **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning** to build an efficient predictive model.  

## Project Overview  
This project involves **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and model training**, culminating in a **Streamlit-based web app** for user-friendly predictions.  

## Steps Followed  

### 1. Data Collection  
- Downloaded the **"Bengaluru_House_Data.csv"** dataset.  

### 2. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning  
- Initial dataset contained the following columns:  
  `area_type, availability, location, size, society, total_sqft, bath, balcony, price`  
- Removed **irrelevant columns**: `area_type`, `society`, `balcony`, and `availability` (as they had minimal impact on pricing).  
- Handled **missing values** by removing rows with null values (as they were relatively small in number).  
- Standardized the **'size'** column by converting values into **BHK** (removing text variations like "Bedroom" and "BHK").  
- Reduced dataset **dimensionality** by removing **locations appearing fewer than 10 times**.  

### 3. Outlier Detection & Removal  
- Removed extreme **price per square foot** outliers (**below ₹300/sqft**).  
- Visualized data using **scatter plots** and **histograms** to confirm outlier removal.  

### 4. Feature Engineering  
- Removed unnecessary **'size'** and **'price_per_sqft'** columns.  
- Created **dummy variables** for **categorical 'location'** feature.  
- Defined **'price'** as the target variable and remaining features as inputs.  

### 5. Model Selection & Training  
- **Train-Test Split**: **80-20** ratio.  
- **Initial Model**: Linear Regression → Achieved **84% accuracy**.  
- Applied **Cross-Validation (`cross_val_score`)** and obtained results:  
  `0.8243, 0.7716, 0.8508, 0.8083, 0.8365` (Average: **81%**)  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used **GridSearchCV** to evaluate multiple models (`Linear Regression`, `Lasso`, `Decision Tree Regressor`).  
- **Best Model**: **Linear Regression** with an improved **accuracy of 88%**.  

### 6. Deployment  
- Developed an **interactive web app** using **Streamlit** for easy user access and predictions.  



## Results & Conclusion  
- The final model achieves **88% accuracy** after hyperparameter tuning.  
- **Predicts housing prices efficiently** based on user inputs.  
- Enables **real-time exploration** of Bangalore’s housing market trends.  

## Tech Stack Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)  
- **Machine Learning** (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Lasso)  
- **Feature Engineering** (One-Hot Encoding, Outlier Removal)  
- **Streamlit** (For Deployment)
